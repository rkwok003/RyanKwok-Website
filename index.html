        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Ryan Kwok. I am currently a student at the University of California Riverside. When eligible, I currently plan on concentrating on accounting. I am passionate about business and can see myself in this career field. I am really good with numbers so that is a reason why I would not only like accounting, but also be good at it. I do not have much professional experience, besides a financial accounting class. However, over the summer I plan on applying for internships in order to boost my resume. My goal for the future is to hopefully one day start my own business and become financially independent enough to travel around the world and not worry about money problems. However, I know that that is an ambitious goal that will take time, but nonetheless, I will try my best to achieve it.
<br><br>

        Some things that I like to do in my free time is go on hikes by myself or play video games with friends. I also really like eating food as they make me feel comfortable and warm on the inside. Sometimes I dream about becoming an ASMR Youtuber and get paid to have people watch me eat. My favorite type of cuisine is Mexican food, I really like burritos and tacos. Some hobbies of mine are going to the gym, playing soccer, and running track. <br><br>

        I have been going to the gym for over six months, I have been playing soccer for over thirteen years of my life, and I have been running track for eight years of my life. I am really into clothes, just like many other teens. I think what you wear can tell you a lot about a person. A specific article of clothing that I am into are watches, I think watches are a good piece of clothing to add to any outfit. They are classy and can overall complete any outfit. I even have a case specifically for my watches. Another accessory that I am interested in are backpacks. I have a whole collection of backpacks and when I am hiking I think they are very useful, while also leveling up your outfit. The only downside is that they make me really hot and I start sweating profusely.
